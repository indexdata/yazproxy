    The YAZ proxy is a single program. After startup it spawns 
    a child process (except on Windows or if option -X is given). 
    The child process is the core of the proxy and it handles all
    communication with clients and servers. The parent process
    will restart the child process if it dies unexpectedly and report
    the reason. For options for YAZ proxy,
    see <xref linkend="proxy-usage"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    As an option the proxy may change user identity to a less priviledged
    user.

   <title>Specifying the Backend Server</title>
   <para>
    When the proxy receives a Z39.50 Initialize Request from a Z39.50
    client, it determines the backend server by the following rules:
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>If the <literal>InitializeRequest</literal> PDU from the
       client includes an 
       <link linkend="otherinfo-encoding"><literal>otherInfo</literal></link>
       element with OID
       <literal>1.2.840.10003.10.1000.81.1</literal>, then the
       contents of that element specify the server to be used, in the
       usual YAZ address format (typically
       <literal>tcp:<parameter>hostname</parameter>:<parameter>port</parameter></literal>)
       as described in
       <ulink url="http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/doc/comstack.addresses.tkl"
	>the Addresses section of the YAZ manual</ulink>.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>Otherwise, the Proxy uses the default server, if one was
       specified in the proxy configuration file. See
       <xref linkend="proxy-config-target"/>.

     <listitem>
      <para>Otherwise, the Proxy uses the default server, if one was

  <section id="proxy-keepalive">
   <title>Keep-alive Facility</title>
   <para>
    The keep-alive is a facility where the proxy keeps the connection to the
    backend server - even if the client closes the connection to the proxy.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a new or another client connects to the proxy again and requests the
    same backend it will be reassigned to this backend. In this case, the
    proxy sends an initialize response directly to the client and an
    initialize handshake with the backend is omitted.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a client reconnects, query and record caching works better, if the
    proxy assigns it to the same backend as before. And the result set
    (if any) is re-used. To achieve this, Index Data defined a session
    cookie which identifies the backend session.
   </para>
   <para>
    The cookie is defined by the client and is sent as part of the
    Initialize Request and passed in an
    <link linkend="otherinfo-encoding"><literal>otherInfo</literal></link>
    element with OID <literal>1.2.840.10003.10.1000.81.2</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Clients that do not send a cookie as part of the initialize request
    may still better performance, since the init handshake is saved.

  <section id="proxy-config-file">
   <title>Proxy Configuration File</title>
   <para>
    The Proxy may read a configuration file using option
    <literal>-c</literal> followed by the filename of a config file.

    The config file is XML based. The YAZ proxy must be compiled 
    with <ulink url="http://www.xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</ulink> and

    <para>
     Multiple <literal>url</literal> element may be used. In that case, then

   <section id="proxy-config-keepalive">
    <title>keepalive</title>
    <para>The <literal>keepalive</literal> element holds information about
     the keepalive Z39.50 sessions. Keepalive sessions are proxy-to-backend
     sessions that is no longer associated with a client session.
    </para>
    <para>The <literal>keepalive</literal> element which is the child of
     the <literal>target</literal>holds two elements:
     <literal>bandwidth</literal> and <literal>pdu</literal>.
     The <literal>bandwidth</literal> is the maximum total bytes
     transferred to/from the target. If a target session exceeds this
     limit, it is shut down (and no longer kept alive). 
     The <literal>pdu</literal> is the maximum number of requests sent
     to the target. If a target session exceeds this limit, it is
     shut down. The idea of these two limits is that avoid very long
     sessions that use resources in a backend (that leaks!).
    </para>
    <para>
     The following sets maximum number of bytes transferred in a
     target session to 1 MB and maxinum of requests to 400.
     <screen>

   <section id="proxy-config-limit">
    <title>limit</title>
    <para>
     The <literal>limit</literal> section specifies bandwidth/pdu requests
     limits for an active session.
     The proxy records bandwidth/pdu requests during the last 60 seconds
     (1 minute). The <literal>limit</literal> may include the
     elements <literal>bandwidth</literal>, <literal>pdu</literal>,
     and <literal>retrieve</literal>. The <literal>bandwidth</literal>
     measures the number of bytes transferred within the last minute.
     The <literal>pdu</literal> is the number of requests in the last
     minute. The <literal>retrieve</literal> holds the maximum records to
     be retrieved in one Present Request.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a bandwidth/pdu limit is reached the proxy will postpone the
     requests to the target and wait one or more seconds. The idea of the
     limit is to ensure that clients that downloads hundreds or thousands of
     records do not hurt other users.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following sets maximum number of bytes transferred per minute to
     500Kbytes and maximum number of requests to 40.

   <section id="proxy-config-attribute">
    <title>attribute</title>

     Well-behaving targets will reject unsupported attributes on their
     own. This feature is useful for targets that do not gracefully
     handle unsupported attributes.
    </para>
    <para>
     Attribute elements may be repeated. The proxy inspects the attribute
     specifications in the order as specified in the configuration file.
     When a given attribute specification matches a given attribute list
     in a query, the proxy takes appropriate action (reject, accept).
    </para>
    <para>
     If no attribute specifications matches the attribute list in a query,
     it is accepted.

    <para>
     The <literal>attribute</literal> element has two required attributes:
     <literal>type</literal> which is the Attribute Type-1 type, and
     <literal>value</literal> which is the Attribute Type-1 value.
     The special value/type <literal>*</literal> matches any attribute
     type/value. A value may also be specified as a list with each
     value separated by comma, a value may also be specified as a
     list: low value - dash - high value.

    <para>
     If attribute <literal>error</literal> is given, that holds a

     <literal>target</literal> and specifies the number of spare
     connection to a target. By default no spare connection are
     created by the proxy. If the proxy uses a target exclusive or
     a lot, the preinit session will ensure that target sessions
     have been made before the client makes a connection and will therefore
     reduce the connect-init handshake dramatically. Never set this to

   <title>Query Caching</title>
   <para>
    Simple stateless clients often send identical Z39.50 searches
    in a relatively short period of time (e.g. in order to produce a
    results-list page, the next page,
    a single full-record, etc). And for many targets, it's
    much more expensive to produce a new result set than to
    reuse an existing one.
   </para>
   <para>
    The proxy tries to solve that by remembering the last query for each
    backend target, so that if an identical query is received next, it
    is turned into Present Requests rather than new Search Requests.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     In a future we release will will probably allows for
     an arbitrary-sized cache for targets supporting named result sets.

    As an option, the proxy may also cache result set records for the

    The Proxy may also be configured to trap particular attributes in

   <section id="record-validation">
   <title>Record Syntax Validation</title>

    The proxy may be configured to accept, reject or convert records.
    When accepted, the target passes search/present requests to the
    backend target under the assumption that the target can honor the
    request (In fact it may not do that). When a record is rejected because
    the record syntax is "unsupported" the proxy returns a diagnostic to the
    client. Finally, the proxy may convert records.
   </para>

    The proxy can convert from MARC to MARCXML and thereby offer an
