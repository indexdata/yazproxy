Use libyaz4.

Make yazproxy work with USEMARCON 3.15.

--- 1.3.5 2009/12/03

Prepare for 64-bit YAZ. yazproxy will still work with YAZ++ 1.1.4 or
later which means YAZ 3.0.47 or later.

--- 1.3.4 2008/06/06

Omit debian directory from tar dist.

--- 1.3.3.2 2008/05/27

Match SRU database (PATH) against target name. Allow omitted explain
section in configuration for SRU.

--- 1.3.3.1 2008/05/21

Z39.50 authentication user is no longer set to client-IP for SRU.

--- 1.3.3 2008/03/20

Added support for limiting the number of sockets (connections) to
a particular backend. The new setting is called 'max-sockets' and
must be defined in the target section.

API verson 3 of USEMARCON is used. Patch by Ere Maijala.

--- 1.3.2 2008/02/29

Added option -D for yazproxy which puts yazproxy in background after
startup.

Fixed bug #2060: Killing yazproxy parent does not kill the child as well.

--- 1.3.1 2007/12/27

Fixed bug #1989: For PQF SRU one char is stipped off query.

Fixed bug #1821: Wrong order of include directories for compiling.

--- 1.3.0 2007/05/09

Debian packages libyazproxy2, libyazproxy2-dev. These depend on
libyazpp2, libyazpp2-dev.

Branch out: YAZPROXY_1_2_1_1_branch .

--- 1.2.1.1 2006/06/09

Added support for thread config element which specifies number of
threads to be used for auhentication modules. By default, no threading
is used which happen to be value 0. Modules will still work but they will
be blocking.

--- 1.2.1 2006/05/01

Fixed problem with log of session ID when HTTP fowarded was in effect.

Fixed a problem with negative numbers in present requests.

Allow client-ip to be logged for each log entry. Specify
<log>client-ip</log> in the configuration.

Added support for limiting the number of initiating connections from
a single IP. limit-connect specifies a limit and if that is reached a
delay is introduced (just as limit-pdu, etc). Also added a new setting
max-connect; if that max value is reached for a single IP the proxy
will terminate the initiating session/connection immediately.

New directive default-client-charset which serves as charset to be
negotiated if client does NOT supports one.

Added support for threaded authentication modules. See
etc/config-modules.xml + mod_sample.cpp for an example.

Added support for Z39.50 character set negotiation. This allows the
proxy to act as a Z39.50 server supporting character set negotiation
for backends not supporting it. New config element target-charset
specifies encoding for target, and MUST be specified in order for
any conversion to take place. Conversion also takes place for SRW/SRU
clients that are negotiate implicitly to UTF-8.

--- 1.0.1 2005/05/27

Fixed bug #355: Yaz proxy does not seem to load balance.
 
--- 1.0 2005/03/14

Added Support OPAC to XML conversion. Triggered by backendtype="opac"
and marcxml="1" in syntax sections. See etc/voyager.xml for example.

Option -X now makes it possible to stop YAZ proxy by sending
"stop" as PROXY target (in init). This used to be debug code in a
#if 0 .. #endif section.

Moved a lot of "private" stuff to proxyp.h so that only Yaz_Proxy
is publicly defined in include/yazproxy/proxy.h.

Authentication info sent to target modified. Element renamed from
"authentication" to "target-authentication" to avoid confusion with
client authentication. It now takes an authentication
type=open|idPass|anonymous . Value is user:group:password for idPass,
user/pass for open. Option -U auth is no longer supported.

Update YAZ Proxy config schema yazproxy.xsd to include definitions
for new elements negotation-charset, negotiation-lang, module, etc. .
Bump version to 0.9.

Started work on facility for module loading (plugins). Initial
effort is to be able to authenticate via a module. See mod_sample.cpp.

YAZ Proxy involved in Character Set and Language Negotiation. Added
support for client's side negotiation record (high priority). Added
support for new elements of YAZ Proxy config file - negotiation-charset,
negotiation-lang for parent element target.
 
--- 0.9 2005/02/07

YAZ Proxy may use USEMARCON to convert between various MARC
formats. Use --with-usemarcon to specify Usemarcon location.
See config-mafi2ma.xml for an example configuration.
Requires USEMARCON 1.5, which can be fetched from:
 http://www.bl.uk/services/bibliographic/usemarcon.html

Added support for XInclude for configuration file(s) so that
configuration can be partitioned in multiple files.

Fixed bug #189: Bad authenticated session transfer.

New config element "authentication" which specifies authentication
(Open v2/v3 Z39.50) to be used for backend.

New config attribute "backendcharset" for syntax element which specifies
charset (encoding) for record that is returned by backend. If omitted
the proxy assumes backend record encoding is MARC-8 (for backwards
compatibility). 

New config attribute "backendtype" for syntax element which specifies
record syntax to be transmitted to backend. This allows proxy to
offer a record syntax different from that offered by backend.

YAZ proxy no longer transmits element set name to backend target when
doing schema conversions. It just gets unset instead (it's optional).

Use YAZ_DOC macro to setup documentation. Added yaz.m4.

--- 0.8 2004/04/23

YAZ proxy control script renamed from yaz-proxy.sh to yazproxyctl.sh.

YAZ proxy executable renamed from yaz-proxy to yaz-proxy.

Older versions of YAZ proxy was part of YAZ++. We've split the
YAZ proxy into a separate project.
